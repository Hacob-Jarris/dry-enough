Node weather app to see past and future weather in one place. I made this with the goal of helping users determine when conditions will be good for rock climbing. This requires both historical and forecast data, which was difficult for me to find in a nice weather app. [Here](https://medium.com/@jacobwharris13/my-weather-app-project-7b612b30776e) is a blog post I wrote while learning how to build it. Try it at https://dryenough.com

I'll probably add a page for each day that will show hourly information and more detailed daily information soon.
